## Feature: Man (or Woman) out of Time

Your foreignness means that your gaffs and breaches of social norms are laughed off or excused instead of being punished. People come from far around to hear you talk, even if they cannot understand you through the accent.

## Suggested Characteristics

An Earthling could come from any one of a number of cultures and countries, but most are in a state of culture shock – at least until they settle in.

| 1  | I make pop culture references that no one else understands.                  |
| 2  | I am melancholic and distracted.      |
| 3  | I am excited by the scientific possibilities this planet presents.                         |
| 4  | I am convinced that this is all a dream.                                                                          |

| 6  | I put on a faux medieval accent.                  |

|:--:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Honour. Bravery and gentility are universal virtues, as true here as anywhere. (Lawful)                      |
| 2  | Faith. This is a land like none other, but I will honour my God and continue to obey His will. (Any)                                  |
| 3  | Knowledge. I must learn everything that I can about this extraordinary place. (Neutral)                   |

|  | I brought a pet with me.
|  | I am blood brother (or sister) of a warrior in this place.
|  | There is someone here that I dreamed of every night before I was transported.

| 2  | Those I meet are savages in need of civilising.                   |
| 3  | I am obsessed with getting back home.              |
| 4  | I look at everything here through rose-coloured glasses.                                                               |
| 5  | I am convinced that all the magic I see is sufficiently-advanced technology.                                    |
| 6  | I am scared of everything here. |
