## Contributing

Pull requests are great, but make sure anything you want to contribute is under the OGL (e.g. no Dungeon Master's Guild content unless it is also OGL-licensed).

1. Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/5srd.github.io.git

2. Make your changes. For simple changes, this probably means just modifying a Markdown file. For more complicated changes, you'll want to have Ruby installed, so you can run `bundle install` and `jekyll serve` in the repo folder to view a copy of the site locally.

3. Include a link to the place where the content was identified as open game content under the OGL.

4. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/5srd/5srd.github.io/compare/).
