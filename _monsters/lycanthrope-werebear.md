> In their humanoid forms, werebears tend to be muscular and broad-shouldered, with stark facial features and dark eyes. Their hair is usually red, brown, or black, and they look like they are used to a lifetime of hard work. Though by far the most benign of common lycanthropes, werebears are shunned by most normal folk, who fear and mistrust their animal transformations. Most live as recluses in forested areas or in small family units among their own kind. They avoid confrontations with strangers but do not hesitate to drive evil humanoids out of their territory.
>
> Some werebears are angry and violent, because of either temperament or a lifetime of harassment from others, and these mean ones aren’t afraid to put an axe in a trespasser’s face or eat someone who pushes them too far. Cool-headed werebears don’t like to speak of these individuals with strangers.

> Even more so than werebear-kin, werebears are natural protectors of the wilderness, and they often associate closely with druids and clerics of nature deities. Although they prefer solitude even more than werebear-kin do, they feel compelled to ensure others benefit from their guidance and magic. Werebears are loners much of the time, but often form small, temporary family units when rearing children. Werebears generally think of all their kin as family, including werebear-kin, and most keep in touch with all family members for security and to share their experiences.
>
> Werebears normally avoid adventure, so adventurers of this species tend to break the mold in more than one way.
>
> Most often, they are restless wanderers who think of the world as their home or failed guardians who survived the destruction of their homes and seek a new purpose or atonement for failure. Others seek out rival lycanthropes in an attempt to reform and support them or, failing that, end the threat they pose to humanity and nature alike.
