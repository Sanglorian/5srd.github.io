> Cousins to dwarves, duergar are foul-tempered creatures that loathe intruders to their underground realmsâ€”but not nearly as much as they do their kinfolk closer to the surface.
>
> Duergar dwell in communities deep underground, and appear as darker, more twisted versions of their kinder kin. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows them to blend with their underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work, dwarven prisoners are generally slain on the spot.
>
> In combat, duergar throw javelins from a distance, then shift to the war pick after a few rounds. If outnumbered, or given sufficient threat (and space), a duergar will use its Enlarge ability and begin lashing out at its enemies.
