> Lions are usually the top animal predators in their territories, though they resort to scavenging if convenient or necessary. They may kill other predators (such as leopards and [hyenas](/monsters/hyena/)) that encroach upon their haunts, but rarely eat these kills unless game is scarce. Most lions do not selectively hunt humanoids, but occasionally one learns what easy kills they are and becomes a man-eater.

> Lions prefer plains but can adapt to living in shallow caves as long as there's a large and stable supply of prey to keep them fed.
