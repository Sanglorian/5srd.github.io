> Kobolds are creatures of the dark, found most commonly in enormous underground warrens or the dark corners of the forest where the sun is unable to reach. Due to their physical similarities, kobolds loudly proclaim themselves the scions of dragonkind, destined to rule the earth beneath the wings of their great god-cousins, but most dragons have little use for the obnoxious pests.
>
> While they may speak loudly of divine right and manifest destiny, kobolds are keenly aware of their own weakness. Cowards and schemers, they never fight fair if they can help it, instead setting up ambushes and double-crosses, holing up in their warrens behind countless crude but ingenious traps, or rolling over the enemy in vast, yipping hordes.
>
> Kobold coloration varies even among siblings from the same egg clutch, ranging through the colors of the chromatic dragons, with red being the most common but white, green, blue, and black kobolds not unheard of.

> **Staring Box.** Many kobold sorcerers make a magical trap called a *staring box*, which resembles a treasure chest or an ivory or rare wooden coffer, such as a merchant might use to transport jewels. When a *staring box* is opened, however, a *hypnotic pattern* spell is unleashed, affecting all those within a 10-foot radius who fail a DC 14 Wisdom save. The pattern remains for 1d6 × 10 minutes. Kobolds have advantage on this save, as they often use such boxes as a form of entertainment, staring slackjawed at their glittering light patterns for hours.
>
> **Smoke Bullets.** It’s unclear whether these sling stones are the product of kobold alchemy, sorcery, or both, but they are fairly effective weapons. They can be hurled as sling stones with normal range, but require only a touch attack to succeed. When they strike a target they release a cloud of gas that requires a DC 13 Constitution save. If the saving throw succeeds, the target is unaffected. If the save fails, the target is poisoned for 2 rounds.
