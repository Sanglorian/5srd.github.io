> Even seasoned adventurers sometimes flinch at the mention of swarms, and even ordinary insects can form irritating swarms under the right conditions. Some trackers claim they can predict the conditions under which insect swarms form. For example, one tracker might insist it's the change in barometric pressure before a storm that triggers swarming, while another might believe it's a change in the prevailing winds. The potential causes are as numerous as the people who espouse them, and if folklore holds a definitive answer, it has yet to become common knowledge.
