    text: The weretiger can use its action to polymorph into a tiger-humanoid hybrid or into a tiger, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

> Weretigers in humanoid form have large eyes, long noses, and sharp cheekbones. Most have brown or red hair, though a few have white, black, or even blue-gray. Their movements appear careful yet casual, and a person observing one could easily assume heâ€™s watching a skilled pickpocket, graceful dancer, or sultry courtesan.

> Weretigers tend to be solitary creatures, only spending time with others of their kind when they feel the urge to breed. Evil weretigers enjoy the thrill of hunting intelligent prey.

> Weretigers are egomaniacs with a natural talent for controlling others with fear and awe, a talent they usually use to reign over the humans they think of as slaves and cattle for the slaughter. Their indisputable power and animal magnetism makes it surprisingly easy for human populations to acquiesce to their rule; many a citizen has called a weretiger impossible to overthrow, and dangerous but not insufferable because she primarily hunts dissidents. Indeed, weretigers often only seek other human prey every few months to keep the rabble afraid. Some infect important servants to act as temporary proxies before exiling or killing them when their usefulness ends. Weretigers favor weretiger-kin as lackeys, as the former think of the latter as lesser (and less threatening) versions of themselves.

> Although not as disciplined as werebears, weretigers are relatively patient and interested in exploiting every advantage they can to achieve overwhelming power. They sometimes operate as infamously ruthless killers for hire if they cannot establish themselves as rulers immediately.
