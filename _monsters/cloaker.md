    text: While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.
  - name: False Appearance
    text: While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.
  - name: Light Sensitivity
    text: While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

       The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.
  - name: Bite
    text: |
       *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5  feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.
  - name: Tail
    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.
  - name: Moan
    text: Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours
  - name: Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
    text: |
      The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

      Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

      A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

> A cloaker's motives are hidden and confusing, and they distrust even their own kind. Their strange shape allows them to disguise themselves as a variety of cloaks, tapestries, and other mundane objects, and stories linger of cloakers that ally with other creatures, hitching a ride on their backs and aiding in their ally's protection for their own inscrutable reasons. A rare few are priests of ancient gods, leading cults of cloakers and skum to undertake all manner of hideous rites and working toward singularly sinister goals.

>  While cloakers can handle objects with their tails, claws, and mouths, they are not as good as humanoids at dealing with fine manipulation, which makes using potion flasks problematic. To get around this problem, cloaker potion-makers (or someone working on their behalf) invented potion-infused fungal stalks or caps. These function exactly like potions except there is no stopper to remove before using the item—as an action, the cloaker puts the fungus in its mouth, chews, and swallows. Potion fungi are usually only 1–2 inches across, and many cloakers impale one onto a grasping claw for easy use in combat (as they have no easy way to carry objects). Other creatures can use potion fungi just as if they were potions, but the paranoid cloakers have been known to add materials that are irritating or toxic to all but the cloaker race, just in case they fall into the wrong hands.
