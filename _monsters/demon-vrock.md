       The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.
  - name: Beak
    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.
  - name: Talons
    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.
  - name: Spores (Recharge 6)
    text: A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.
  - name: Stunning Screech (1/Day)
    text: The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14  Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the vrock's next turn.

> Profane champions of the Abyss, vrocks embody all the rage, hatred, and violence of that despicable realm. As ravenous and grotesquely opportunistic as the scavengers they resemble, vrocks delight in bloodshed, relishing the sounds and sensations of ripping the still-pulsing entrails from a living husk.

> A typical vrock stands 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. Vrocks generally form from the evil souls of hateful and wrathful mortals, particularly those who were career criminals, mercenaries, or assassins.
