> Ferocious and bestial in form, the glabrezu is in fact a master of trickery and lies. The glabrezu uses its magic and hoarded treasures to tempt the desires of mortal humanoids.

> A glabrezu stands 18 feet tall and weighs just over 6,000 pounds. These treacherous demons form from the souls of the treasonous, the false, and the subversiveâ€”souls of mortals who, in life, bore false witness or used treachery and deceit to ruin the lives of others.
