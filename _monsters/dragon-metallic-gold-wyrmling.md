      The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

      *Fire Breath.* The dragon exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13  Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

      *Weakening Breath.* The dragon exhales gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
