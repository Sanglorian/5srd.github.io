    text: The werewolf can use its action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

> In their humanoid form, werewolves look like normal people, though some tend to look a bit feral and have wild hair. Eyebrows that grow together, index fingers longer than the middle fingers, and strange birthmarks on the palm of the hand are all commonly accepted indications that a person is in fact a werewolf. Of course, such telltale signs are not always accurate, for such physical traits exist in normal people as well, but in areas where werewolves are a common problem, the traits can be damning regardless.

> Of all the various types of lycanthropes, it is the werewolf that is the most widespread and the most feared. Stories of werewolves haunting lonely forest roads, prowling misty moors on the outskirts of rural societies, or dwelling in the shadows of the largest cities are widespread as well. In most societies, werewolves are feared and despised—and with good reason, as the typical werewolf personifies all that is savage and bestial in a lycanthrope. This isn't to say that good-aligned werewolves are unknown, but they're certainly a minority among their kind, and most werewolves are evil murderers who delight in the hunt and the succulent taste of raw meat.

> Just as wolves are pack animals, werewolves have been known to gather in colonies and live among their own kind, humanoid by day and beast at night. Visitors to werewolf villages are generally rushed out of town before nightfall so as not to discover the citizenry's dark secret—unless, of course, the pack decides that the unlucky visitor won't be missed by friends back home.

> Werewolves are hunters and scavengers. They usually live in packs, as loners tend to run wild or slip up without a pack to support and protect them, and thus get themselves killed by authorities or adventurers relatively quickly. When a number of werewolf packs exist in an area, the strongest leader among the packs generally asserts authority as a pack lord, and all werewolves in the area defer to her or risk her wrath, often creating a stable situation—at least until her strength falters.
>
> Most of the few werewolf adventurers constantly fight a losing battle against their own impulses, hoping to find a cure or a method of staving off the beast within over the course of their travels. A rare few werewolves cling more steadily to their humanity, and use their dread powers to advance external goals, rather than merely battling the monster inside themselves.
