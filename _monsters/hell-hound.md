> The blood hawk is nearly identical to a normal hawk and is often mistaken for one, but a blood hawk is stronger and far more aggressive than a normal hawk. Blood hawks love the taste of human flesh and are relentless in their hunt of human prey. They often steal gems from the corpses of their humanoid prey, which they use to line their nests.

> Blood hawks are fierce combatants and quickly swoop down on their prey, attacking with their razor sharp talons and beak. Blood hawks fight to the death.
