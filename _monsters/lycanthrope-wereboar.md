    text: The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a boar-humanoid hybrid or into a boar, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
  - name: Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form Only)
    text: If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

> In their humanoid forms, wereboars tend to be stout with upturned noses, bristly hair, and a noticeable overbite. They usually have red, brown, or black hair, though a few are golden blond, pale blond, or even bald. Chin whiskers are common, but males often can’t grow full beards. Because they can be stubborn and aggressive when riled up, wereboars usually live in their own communities rather than mixing with non-lycanthropes; a wereboar’s farm or ranch doesn’t look out of the ordinary. Wereboars tend to have large families with many children.
>
> Many wereboars are known to have especially bad tempers, rivaling those of murderous werewolves, and even other lycanthropes tend to avoid them. This suits the wereboars fine, especially as some weretigers and werewolves have been known hunt young wereboars.

> Wereboars in human form can be distinguished from wereboar-kin by their spiteful demeanor and need to control others. They frequently live as bandits or violently dominate villages or small fiefdoms.
>
> They may choose to infect the targets of their romantic feelings in the hope that it binds them together, often with predictably troubling results. Wereboards are even more ashamed of their condition than wereboar-kin.
>
> Wereboars are among the lycanthropes most likely to embrace a life of adventure, thinking of it as a way to prove their worth and intimidate those they wish to control.
>
> They are most often barbarians, but wereboar fighters and rogues are also common.
