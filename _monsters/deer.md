> Shy and wary, deer range from the arctic to the tropics. They are very flexible creatures, adapting easily to their climate and able to survive in all but the harshest of temperatures. Deer are very flexible in their diets as well, able to exist on plants, insects, fish, and even dead birds. Deer are excellent swimmers and have been known to swim to a distance of five miles in the water. These statistics represent the typical white-tailed deer; they can also be used to represent other deer-like animals such as caribou and antelope.
