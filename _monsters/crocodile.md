> A crocodile is a primeval reptile that dwells in swamps or along the banks of rivers, a habitat that often puts it in violent contact with unsuspecting prey that come to the water's edge to drink.

> The typical crocodile is 14 feet long and weighs 1,400 pounds, but larger species exist. Alligators are similar to crocodiles, but are typically Medium rather than Large size.
