    text: The wererat can use its action to polymorph into a rat-humanoid hybrid or into a giant rat, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

> Natural wererats tend to be short and wiry, with constantly darting eyes and frequent nervous twitches. Males often have thin, ragged moustaches.
>
> Wererats prefer cities where they can blend in with the humanoid and rat population. Their abilities make them especially good at thieving and spying, and in many cities the thieves' guild employs numerous wererat members.

> Wererats are a little more insular than wererat-kin, and more fond of disappearing among the rats of the sewers than among the commoners of the city. Entire thieves' guilds and gangs of dozens or even hundreds of wererats can be found in the dark parts of urban hubs. Wererats and wererat-kin agree that secrecy is paramount to their survival, but a head wererat who expects to be in charge of all matters concerning lycanthrope secrecy in his area can become hostile toward nightskulks who do not heed him.
>
> Wererats' cowardice and preference for strength in numbers often dissuades them from becoming adventurers, but their natural ambition and ingenuity can be great assets should they ever end up alone. This most often happens when one or a few wererats dare or are forced by circumstance to strike out on their own to seek wealth, powerful magic items, and other advantages over those who threaten them. Occasionally, powerful head wererats send parties of wererats out to secure their interests around the city and beyond, and such endeavors can easily lead to a life of adventure.
