    text: The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat (speed 20 ft.), a raven (speed 20 ft., fly 60 ft.), or a spider (speed 20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

> Born directly from the pits of Hell, imps are among the least of the true devils; these vicious, manipulative fiends, however, hold an important role in the corruption of mortal souls. Unfettered from the ranks and duties of diabolical armies, imps delight in any opportunity to travel to the Material Plane and subtly tempt mortals toward acts of ever-greater depravity.
>
> Imps vary widely in appearance, ranging through a spectrum of bestial traits and grotesque body shapes, though most take the forms of red-skinned, winged humanoids with bulbous features. Such a typical imp stands a mere 2 feet tall, has a 3-foot wingspan, and weighs 10 pounds.
>
> One in every thousand imps possesses the ability to communicate telepathically with creatures within 50 feet. These imp consulars are highly prized by powerful devils, who send them to serve their favored minions or to corrupt mortals with great destinies. Diabolists tell of other breeds of imps with similarly specialized abilities, but if such creatures truly exist they are an especially rare lot.

> As a placation to their tiny egos, imps favor small, bloody sacrifices that suggest their summoner's willingness to do evil. Giving a heart cut from the breast of a still-living dove to an imp targeted by a *planar binding* spell increases the spell's DC by 2.
