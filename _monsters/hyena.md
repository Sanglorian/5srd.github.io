> Hyenas are pack hunters infamous for their cunning and their unnerving, laughter-like vocalizations. They are largely scavengers, but aren't above supplementing their diet of carrion with fresh prey.
>
> Hyenas tend to hunt alone, but when hunting as a pack they typically send one or two members against a foe's front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from behind.
>
> Many of the savage humanoid races, particularly [gnolls](/monster/gnoll/), use hyenas as guard dogs. Such hyenas typically wear leather barding and are trained from birth to be vicious and savageâ€”many such creatures are advanced hyenas.
