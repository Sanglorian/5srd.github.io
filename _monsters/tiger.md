> Tigers are usually the top animal predators in their territories, and have been known to kill bears, crocodiles, giant snakes, wolves, and even other great cats. Even humanoids are far from safe, especially in cases where a tiger has developed a taste for humanoid flesh. Tigers prefer terrain with plenty of cover and proximity to water as their hunting grounds.
