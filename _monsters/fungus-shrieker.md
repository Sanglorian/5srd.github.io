> This mindless plant emits a loud, piercing wail when living creatures pass near it. Underground denizens have learned the noise indicates the presence of prey, and flock to its source. The remnants of creatures slain around the shrieker fertilize it. Shriekers often form symbiotic relationships with other plant creatures, such as violet fungus and phantom fungus, and attract creatures with their shriek which are then slain by the more mobile plants.

> Some underground denizens cultivate shriekers as guards and intruder alarms.
