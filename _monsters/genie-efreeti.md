> The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Plane of Fire. An efreeti stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds.

> Efreet have few allies among geniekind. They certainly hate [djinn](/monsters/genie/djinni/), and attack them on sight. They hold an equally strong enmity for marids, and view the jann as frail and weak. Efreet often work closely with shaitans, yet even then alliances are temporary at best.

> These warlike creatures value weapons with enhancement bonuses of at least +2 and scrolls of 4th-level or higher spells. Giving one to a djinni targeted by a *planar binding* spell increases the spell's DC by 2. Efreet also appreciate attractive humanoid slaves, which increase the DC by 1 for every 10 slaves offered.
