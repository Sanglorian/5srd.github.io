      The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

      - At will: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *thunderwave*
      - 3/day each: *create food and water* (can create wine instead of water), *tongues*, *wind walk*
      - 1/day each: *conjure elemental* (air elemental only), *creation*, *gaseous form*, *invisibility*, *major image*, *plane shift*
actions:
  - name: Multiattack
    text: The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.
  - name: Scimitar
    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).
  - name: Create Whirlwind
    text: |
      A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

      A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

> The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Plane of Air. They are said to be made of the stuff of clouds, with the strength of the mightiest storms. A djinni is about 10 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.
>
> Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow. When faced with no other option than melee combat, most viziers prefer to turn invisible immediately after striking to avoid retaliation. They wield masterwork scimitars though many employ magic scimitars, falchions, or other weapons.
>
> Among other genies, djinn get along well with jann and marids. They are frequently at odds with the shaitans, and are sworn enemies of the [efreet](/monsters/genie-efreeti/), despising these fiery genies more than any other genie race. So legendary is the conflict between the efreet and the djinn that many spellcasters attempt (to varying degrees of success) to secure a djinni's servitude by promising to aid the cause against their hated enemies.

> Tomes of knowledge or powerful wondrous items tempt djinn. Giving one to a djinni targeted by a *planar binding* spell increases the spell's DC by 2.
