> Crabs are small crustaceans with eight legs and two pincers or claws. Aquatic scavengers, crabs can also survive on land for long periods, but must keep their gills moist.

> Some crabs are particularly well-adapted to life on land and can be found living in burrows dug to catch rainwater, or high in the branches of large trees. These "land crabs" use the same statistics as normal crabs, but are favored as familiars because they can live for long periods of time with only a little more water than a normal animal would need to drink.
