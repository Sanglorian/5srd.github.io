> Known to many scholars as the gigantopithecus, the giant ape is a much more dangerous and bestial creature than the relatively peaceful [ape](/monsters/ape/). The giant ape attacks anything that intrudes on its territory, including other giant apes not of its troop, and does not break off the attack until the trespasser is dead or runs off.

A giant ape makes no displays of toughness or warnings before it attacksâ€”it simply leaps into action with little or no provocation, grappling and smashing its opponents.
