> Like their smaller cousins, giant weasels have long, slender bodies and short legs, and come in a variety of colors from reddish brown to snowy white. Giant weasels are active and tenacious predators, and have a reputation for being as clever as they are quick. Both highly aggressive and extremely territorial, they frequently attack creatures that are much larger than they are.

> Giant weasels are often trained to serve as guards and mounts by various Small humanoids. Adult giant weasels can grow to be 5 feet long, stand as high as 2-1/2 feet tall at the shoulder, and weigh up to 150 pounds.
