      The sphinx is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The sphinx has the following cleric spells prepared:

      - Cantrips (at will): *sacred flame*, *spare the dying*, thaumaturgy*
      - 1st level (4 slots): *command*, *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*
      - 2nd level (3 slots): *lesser restoration*, *zone of truth*
      - 3rd level (3 slots): *dispel magic*, *tongues*
      - 4th level (3 slots): *banishment*, *freedom of movement*
      - 5th level (2 slots): *flame strike*, *greater restoration*
      - 6th level (1 slot): *heroes' feast*
actions:
  - name: Multiattack
    text: The sphinx makes two claw attacks.
  - name: Claw
    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.
  - name: Roar (3/Day)
    text: |
      The sphinx emits a magical roar. Each time it roars before finishing a long rest, the roar is louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.

      *First Roar.* Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      *Second Roar.* Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1  minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      *Third Roar.* Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

> The mightiest of the common sphinxes, androsphinxes see themselves as all that is worthy and noble in the species and carry themselves as though the weight of the world rests upon their good example. They view criosphinxes with paternalistic condescension, hieracosphinxes with poorly veiled disgust, and gynosphinxes as the only other sphinxes worthy of their time. Androsphinxes put on a gruff and cantankerous front to outsiders. They make no effort to hide annoyance when displeased. Androsphinxes tend to be territorial, though less so than other sphinxes. They almost invariably warn and bluster before attacking, and nearly always heed a call to parley. Androsphinxes barter information and conversation for safe passage, not treasure.
