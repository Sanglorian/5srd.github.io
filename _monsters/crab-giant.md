> Giant crabs behave much like their smaller cousins, feeding on both plant material like algae and fungus and animal matter such as fish, seabirds, and even unwary humanoids. The coloration of a giant crab's hard exoskeleton varies widely depending on species, and over time even shifts in response to its diet.

> Some giant crabs can grow to Large or Huge size. While the shells of these oversized giant crabs can become as thick and hard as rock, they almost always have a vulnerable point that can be attacked to cause massive damage.
