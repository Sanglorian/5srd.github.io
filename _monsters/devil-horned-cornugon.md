       The devil makes three melee attacks: two with its fork and one with its tail. It can use Hurl Flame in place of any melee attack.
  - name: Fork
    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage.
  - name: Tail
    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or lose  10 (3d6) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 10 (3d6). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12  Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
  - name: Hurl Flame
    text: |
      *Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, range 150  ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.

> Among the deadliest of the archdevils' warriors and able commanders of lesser fiends, horned devils spread the rule of Hell wherever they tread. These greater devils are trained, forged, and reforged to be among the most lethal, merciless, and obedient warriors in the multiverse. While rank-and-file horned devils are called cornugons, the greatest of their kind are known as malebranche.

> A typical horned devil rises to a hulking 9 feet tall, bears 14-foot-wide wings, and weighs 700 pounds.
