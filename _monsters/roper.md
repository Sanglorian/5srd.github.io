    text: While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.
  - name: Grasping Tendrils
    text: The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it.
  - name: Spider Climb
    text: The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

       The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.

  - name: Tendril
    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper can't use the same tendril on another target.
  - name: Reel
    text: The roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 feet straight toward it.

> The roper is an ambush hunter. Capable of altering the coloration and shape of its body, a roper in hiding looks remarkably like a stalagmite of stone or ice (or in low-ceilinged chambers, a stony or icy pillar). In areas without such features to hide among, a roper can compress its body into a much more squat, boulder-like shape. The strands it extrudes are not flesh but a thick, semi-liquid material similar to partially melted wax but with the strength of an iron chain and the ability to numb flesh and sap strength. The roper can manipulate these strands with great finesse, and can fling them as far as 50 feet to snatch objects that attract its attention.

> Although alien and monstrous in shape, the roper is in fact relatively intelligent. They do not form large societies (although ropers can be found living among some deep-dwelling denizens like the intellect devourers, with whom they have been known to sometimes ally), but often congregate in small clusters. While no genius, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, a roper's appetite always wins out over its intellectual curiosityâ€”especially in cases where pets are constantly outmaneuvering their keeper's wits and patience.
