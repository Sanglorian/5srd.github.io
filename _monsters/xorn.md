> Strange creatures as big around as they are tall, xorns have little interest in natives of the Material Plane—except for the gems and precious metals they might be carrying. Lurking beneath the surface for what might seem long stretches of time to humans, a xorn might wait months, even years, for the right treat to come along, assaulting the being carrying its favorite meal, such as a certain gemstone or the right sort of silver. Adventurers who frequent regions inhabited by xorns often carry with them small chunks of raw ore or relatively inexpensive gemstones or crystals to use as bribes. While the price of a gemstone or piece of metal is often in direct proportion to the object’s flavor and desirability as a meal, most xorns are quite gluttonous and prefer quantity over quality when it comes to food.

> Treasure found carried by a xorn or stashed in its lair amounts to little more than snacks set aside for another day. An offering of a particularly delicious (and expensive) jewel or piece of precious metal can swiftly secure a xorn’s temporary allegiance. Since xorns can swim through solid rock with ease, they make excellent guides in underground regions.
