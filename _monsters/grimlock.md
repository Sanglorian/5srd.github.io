> Foul, subterranean creatures, grimlocks form primitive societies and spend most of their time hunting for food, fighting amongst themselves or attacking other creatures for loot and pillage. When roused, grimlocks form small war parties to raid other humanoids in search of food or slaves. It is not uncommon for grimlocks to raid surface communities in the mountains or near entrances to the underdeep. It is said they prefer human meat above all others. This has led some scholars to assume grimlocks descend from surface dwellers who lost their way in the lightless depths and eventually had to resort to cannibalism to survive. Since sight was not required in such an environment, grimlocks developed other senses at the cost of their eyes.

> Both genders are muscular, gray in color (hence their natural camouflage), smelly, and hard to distinguish with a casual glance. Their primitive nature means grimlocks cannot form large or complex societies. Even if they did, their natural aggressiveness would soon turn them on each other. Rarely, a powerful warlock or medusa will organize several small tribes into a larger force but only for a short time.
